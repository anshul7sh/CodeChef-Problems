Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1). 

For each number we will check that is the number is divisible is by k than we will increase the count variable by 1 and check for the next. At last 
the count variable stores the count of numbers divisible by k so we will simply print that one.

Note that this problem is for testing fast input-output.
We can use scanf, printf in C langauge, which are quite fast in general :)

Usually, you can use scanf/printf in C++.
However, if you want to use cin/cout, it is usually slow.
To make it faster. Use cin.tie(NULL) and set ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)
See the code for details.
