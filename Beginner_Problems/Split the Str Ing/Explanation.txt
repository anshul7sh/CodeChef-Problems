Approach 1:-

Time Complexity:-O(N).
Space Complexity:-O(1). 

Let us assume that B is a substring of a A than the last character of string B would also be a substring of A hence we can say that the new string B 
will be the last character of string S and the string A is rest of the string. So if we can find that is last character occurs in the rest of the 
string than we can say that we can split string into 2 halfs as given else we can't. We are just seeing the last character because if this character 
is not in the string that any substring of S as B which will break from the last will not be a substring of A as last character of B is not in A.
