Approach 1:-

For each test case we are going to do the following operations:-

We will run a loop untill we reach the city Y where we are present or any already covid infect city. If we reach the city Y than it represents that 
we will also get affected hence we will print Yes else if we reach a city which is already infected with covid without reaching our city Y than it 
represents that the city Y will not get infected in future and hence we can print No as result. Now to store the infected citites we are using a set 
so that it will become easier to memorise them.
